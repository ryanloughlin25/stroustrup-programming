Execute the below program on a "piece of paper" using the input "The cat cat jumped"

#include "../std_lib_facilities.h"

int main()
{
	string previous = " ";
	string current;
	while (cin>>current) {
		if (previous == current) {
			cout << "repeated word: " << current << '\n';
		}
		previous = current;
	}
	return 0;
}

define the string previous and initialize its value to " "
define the string current
loop until cin has been read, which is 4 iterations because the input contains 4 words
	read "The" from cin and assign it to current
	compare previous to current for equality, " " is not equal to "The"
	assign "The" to previous

	read "cat" from cin and assign it to current
	compare previous to current for equality, "The" is not equal to "cat"
	assign "cat" to previous

	read "cat" from cin and assign it to current
	compare previous to current for equality, "cat" is equal to "cat"
	write "repeated word: cat\n" to cout
	assign "cat" to previous

	read "jumped" from cin and assign it to current
	compare previous to current for equality, "cat" is not equal to "jumped"
	assign "jumped" to previous
return
